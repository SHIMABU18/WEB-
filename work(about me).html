And waht is more, I got the scholarship to go Thailand in same year and gain Eiken 2.</p>

    <p>You may think that I got the money to gain the experience. But I am not. I did part-time six days a week and also had classes six days a week. I did not have enough knowledge of English to catch up my classmates and gain them. However the experience which I had in Canada's fee is still i have to pay so I'm working on it. In Canada, I spent three months with awesome friends. My schedule was the shortest compared with others and I wanted to archive something. I did volunteer and got the best score of math.
       The house that I was in hadn’t enough bus so I and my bus driver were alone and talked a lot. </p>

I was too nervous to be part of her family but also made me nervous because of that. But she gave me unconditional love and kindness not only I left Ireland but also everywhere I am. I miss her so bad and want to meet her as soon as possible. I hope everyone who I met are stay safe especially my lovely mom. </p>

Especially it was lucky to meet you Olivia(I hope she will see this). She is the nicest person who can speak Mandarin, English and Japanese well. She is my big sister and teacher now.
